## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture:
```
LearningContent
├── Video Step (all milestones)
├── Practice Step
│   ├── Milestones 1-8: Audio Recording
│   └── Milestones 9-19: WordPuzzle
└── Test Step (all milestones)
```

### Data Flow:
1. **Trainer adds video URL** → Stored in video lecture list
2. **Trainer adds words to puzzle** → Stored in puzzle state
3. **Student clicks green boxes** → Words are revealed automatically
4. **Progress tracking** → Maintained through existing lesson completion system

### State Management:
- **WordPuzzle state**: Manages puzzle words, trainer mode, and revealed words
- **LearningContent state**: Manages current step and practice progress
- **TrainerDashboard state**: Manages video lectures and form data

## Benefits

1. **Simplified video management**: No file uploads needed, just URLs
2. **Interactive learning**: Students can actively engage with word puzzles
3. **Customizable content**: Trainers can create custom word puzzles
4. **Automatic evaluation**: No manual grading needed for word puzzles
5. **Maintained consistency**: Milestones 1-8 keep their original audio features
6. **Scalable design**: Easy to add more words or modify puzzle behavior

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Starting the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigating to the trainer dashboard
3. Adding video URLs instead of uploading files
4. Switching to trainer mode in word puzzles (milestones 9-19)
5. Adding words to the puzzle grid
6. Switching to student mode and clicking green boxes to reveal words

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistence**: Save puzzle words to backend/database
2. **Multiple puzzles**: Allow different puzzles for different milestones
3. **Scoring system**: Track student performance on word puzzles
4. **Hint system**: Provide hints for difficult words
5. **Timer**: Add time-based challenges
6. **Leaderboard**: Compare student performance
