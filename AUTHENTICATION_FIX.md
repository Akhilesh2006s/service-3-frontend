# 🔐 Fix Authentication Issues - Remove Button Not Working

## 🚨 **Problem**
The "Remove" button for students and evaluators is not working because of authentication issues. You'll see errors like:
- "Access denied. No token provided"
- "401 Unauthorized" errors in the console
- "Token from localStorage: Missing"

## ✅ **Quick Fix - Restore Authentication**

### **Option 1: Use the Restore Auth Button (Recommended)**
1. Look for the **🔑 Restore Auth** button in the header (yellow button)
2. Click it to restore your authentication
3. The page will reload and authentication should work
4. Try the Remove button again

### **Option 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Run these commands:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   ```
4. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
5. **Re-login** with your credentials

### **Option 3: Manual Browser Cache Clear**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application/Storage tab**
3. **Clear all storage:**
   - Click "Clear storage" or "Clear site data"
   - Or manually delete:
     - `telugu-basics-token`
     - `telugu-basics-user`
4. **Refresh and re-login**

## 🔧 **Why This Happens**
- Authentication tokens can expire or get corrupted
- Browser cache issues can clear stored tokens
- Network issues can prevent proper token storage
- The system expects valid JWT tokens for API calls

## 🎯 **Expected Result After Fix**
- ✅ Remove button works for students
- ✅ Remove button works for evaluators  
- ✅ No more "Access denied" errors
- ✅ API calls succeed with proper authentication
- ✅ Students and evaluators can be properly managed

## 📱 **If Problems Persist**
1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Ensure you're logged in as a Trainer**
3. **Try a different browser**
4. **Contact support if issues continue**

## 🚀 **Prevention**
- Always use the logout button instead of closing the browser
- Keep your browser updated
- Clear cache periodically if you experience issues
- Use the "Restore Auth" button when authentication fails
